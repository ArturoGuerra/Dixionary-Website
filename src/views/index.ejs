        <hr>
        <p class="content">
            Scammer language is a language based on hov indian scammers speak. This amazing language is based on the inferior english language. Scammer language is basically changing seweral letter in a vord. Like in the vord Dictionary ve change ct for x and ve get the vord dixionary. Ve also hawe the most common change vhich is changing any v's to w's and wice wersa. This sometimes causes a lot of confusion since there are some vords that hawe a meaning in english if you vhere to
            change a v to w, ve still do it and svap the meanings. Ve also hawe th vhich is simply changed to only a t. Of course there are exception of the rules, like the vord compauter, vhich is unique since it doesn't hawe a patern. Owerall scammer langauge is oviously the superior choice.

        <h1 class="subtitle">Hate</h1>

Their main reason is that it doesn't make sense or its just plain stupid, thankfully they hawen't read the vebsite. Tankfuly after reading this people might change their main since it should make sence if they hawe vorking brain lool. Please don't kill me.
